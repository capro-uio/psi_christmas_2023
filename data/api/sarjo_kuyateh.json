It remains unclear whether cross-modal integration of sight and sound generalizes to other visible vocal articulations like those made by singers. We sur..."

Under low control, individuals might rely more heavily on Pavlovian bias (PB), which facilitates and inhibits actions when facing appetitive and aversive cues, respectively. More recently, extreme PB was implicated in..."
