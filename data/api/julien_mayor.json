We demonstrate that it is possible to process online many superimposed streams of input. This is despite the fact that the stored information is spread throughout the network. We show that simple output structures are powerful enough to ex..."]

Different mechanisms explaining this vocabulary spurt have been proposed, either through endogenous factors such as learning capacity or exogenous factors, such as frequency of word usage. We demonstrate that..."]
