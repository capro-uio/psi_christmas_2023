In all of the 9 temperamental categories the MZ twin pairs were more alike than the DZ same-sexed twins at both 2 and 9 months of age. New temperamental data have been collected and analyzed on this same sample..."]

By comparing the MZ and DZ groups, we found that genetic factors play an important role in..."]
