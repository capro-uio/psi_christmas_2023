Omid does research in Clinical Biochemistry, Metabolic Disorders, Gastrointestinal diseases, Neurochemistry, and Molecular Biology. Dear All, I need a high-quality method/protocol to efficiently extract acylcarnitines from fecal specimens for further LC-MS/MS analysis. This method must be feasible and removes the interfering metabolites and compounds existing in the matrix of stool specimen. In other words, acylcarnitines should be extracted with high degrees of purity. Can you please help me if you have a reliable protocol or SOP in this context? Thank you so much. BW   Dear Researchers, I want to know that when we treat rats or mice with probiotics supplementation, are the consumed bacteria able to cross the BBB to reach the central nervous system (CNS) and neurons? In other words, is there any mechanism to transfer probiotics such as Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium species across the BBB?  Thank you so much  ",
