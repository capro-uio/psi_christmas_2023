I have not landed on a valid climate-related psychological vulnerability scale so far. Now I am wondering if someone can make a recommendation. Please advise if adapting The Psychological Vulnerability Scale would be a good idea? The psychological vulnerability scale is a 6 items scale (PVS; Sinclair & Wallston, 1999). I have used it in the past with high reliability in the covid related PVS.Best wishes, Gulnaz  Hi RG colleagues, I am looking for resources and activities for my class on cross-cultural studies. In particular, I am looking for resources for a module on the intersection of race and gender and how that impacts intercultural anxiety. Any leads would be super helpful. Warm regards, Gulnaz   Dear colleagues, Do you think that the peer review process entails experiences of racism? Recently, this issue came up in discussion with a few students who are people of colour. I found it very disheartening but I am sure it is way more discouraging for young graduates to experience racism in the peer-review process. Is there anything that can be done to make the reviewers more objective and not hung up on colonial and racist legacies? Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thank you!  Warm regards, Gulnaz  In the recent weeks since mass scale vaccination is rolling out in most developed countries, the process seems to be running relatively smooth. In many developing countries it's being indicated that people are having doubts about the vaccine itself. Do you think cultural and religious beliefs are driving some of these impacts? ",
