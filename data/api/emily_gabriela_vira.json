I am currently a part of the Kort project where we are investigating the effectiveness of a recently developed evidence-based transdiagnostic intervention. We are using an intensive longitudinal design to track changes in adolescents' emtoion regulation skills before and during the intervention period, we will assess whether these changes relate to improving youths' well-being and reducing youths' mental health problems. I am currently planning out my masters' thesis design and will be working with a large data set with variables that have been meseasured at two time points. Intially I thought of just using a general cross lagged panel model, however after some reading I understood that a RI-CLPM controls for stable trait variables. Though it seems that the model is identified with at least three time points? I cannot find a direct clear answer to this question. ",
