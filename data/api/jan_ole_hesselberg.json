However, I am not sure how to calculate the effect sizes from intraclass correlations and I have a hard time finding answers elsewhere.Hope some of you might know. This is not my area of expertise and I suspect this is fairly basic. I have two independent groups of experts that have rated two different sets of applications. I have calculated the intraclass correlations (single measure, one-way random effects) for both groups. Now I want to test the difference for statistical significance. What is the best method for doing that?Here are some numbers:Group 1:ICC (1,2) = 0.36 (0.28–0.43 95% CI)Numbers of experts: 19Number of paired ratings: 1.085Group 2:ICC (1,2) = 0.33 (0.25-0.40 95% CI)Number of experts: 22Number of paired ratings: 1.304",
