The potential of using biochar together with plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) as a soil fertilization technique, offers an alternative way for sustainable agriculture. In the present study biochar and acid stress adapted PGPR inoculants were ap..."

One of the main issues nowadays in studying biochar as soil amendment is to upscale experiments and move from short-term, laboratory conditions to long-term field trials.\nThis paper presents a long-term field study, being the..."
