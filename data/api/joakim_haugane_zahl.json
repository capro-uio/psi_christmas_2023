We argue that possessions are likely treated differently across different types of cooperative relationships. Whereas Boyer's computational model might in principle account for this, the theory would benefit from a..."

To be able to learn the intricacy of social rules and practices, infants should have the capability to recognize social details and have some basic expectations about social interaction. That is, infants should have an early emerging social-grammar instilled with differentiated expectations and motives that match the basic types of relations humans obtain. Investigating and revealing this social-grammar is central to my research. Understanding this social-grammar has the potential to increase the understanding of our evolved social nature.",
