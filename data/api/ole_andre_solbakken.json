    "bio": "Ole André Solbakken currently works as Professor of Clinical Psychology and Head of the Clinical Section at the Department of Psychology, University of Oslo. Ole André does research in Emotion, Clinical Psychology and Differential Psychology. One of his current projects is 'Affect Integration, Psychopathology, and Psychotherapy: Conceptual Issues, Construct Validity, and the Prediction of Change.' Ole André works as a dual competancy scholar combining a clinical speciality in psychotherapeutic treatment of adults with scientific inquiry into the processes and outcomes of pyschotherapy, the mechanisms and development of psychopathology, and the role of emotion in mental health and psychological functioning. Tomkins proposed that various profiles of general neural firing patterns would correspond to activators of distinct affect categories, what he termed the density of neural firing. E.g. very rapid increases in the density of neural firing would activate surprise, rapid increases would activate fear, slower increases would activate interest, very rapid decreases would activate laughter,  rapid decreases would activate joy, prolonged intermediately elevated levels of firing density would activate distress, while prolonged highly elevated levels would activate anger. The model is very appealing in its simplicity and potential implications, but has never been tested. The question is, could this be done and how?I have wondered about using auditory stimulation as a proxy for the different firing patterns, e.g music or other sounds to test if this could produce the affect activations posited by the theory, but maybe there are better ways. Happy for any answer and input or collaborations on this.  ",
